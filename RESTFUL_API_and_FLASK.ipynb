        "1.  What is a RESTful API\n",
        "    -  A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a style of web service that allows different software applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.\n",
        "2.   Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "     - An API specification is a detailed document or blueprint that describes how an API works. It defines the endpoints, request and response formats, data types, authentication methods, and other essential details needed for developers to understand and interact with the API effectively.\n",
        "3.    What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs\n",
        "     -   Flask is a lightweight, flexible web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications and APIs. It provides essential tools and libraries to handle routing, request/response handling, and templating, but leaves many architecture choices up to the developer, offering high flexibility.\n",
        "4.    What is routing in Flask\n",
        "     - Routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL patterns that map to specific functions (called view functions) in your application. When a user visits a particular URL, Flask uses the route definitions to determine which function should handle the request and generate a response.\n",
        "5.    How do you create a simple Flask application\n",
        "      -   install , create,  run,  access\n",
        "6.    What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs\n",
        "      -   GET\n",
        "      -   POST\n",
        "      -   PUT\n",
        "      -   PATCH\n",
        "      -   DELETE\n",
        "7.  What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask\n",
        "    -  The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to define the URL pattern (route) that triggers a specific view function. It maps a URL endpoint to a Python function, so when a user visits that URL, Flask executes the associated function and returns its response.\n",
        "8.   What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods\n",
        "     - GET: Requests data from a server; appends data in the URL, making it visible and limited in size. Used for retrieving information.\n",
        "      - POST: Sends data to the server in the request body; data is not visible in the URL and can be larger. Used for submitting or updating information.\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs\n",
        "    - Error handlers with @app.errorhandler() decorator, which catch specific HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500) and return custom responses.\n",
        "10.  How do you connect Flask to a SQL  database\n",
        "     - Choose a Database Library: Common options include sqlite3, SQLAlchemy, or Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Install the Necessary Package (if using SQLAlchemy):\n",
        "\n",
        "       bash\n",
        "      pip install flask-sqlalchemy\n",
        "      Configure the Database in Flask:\n",
        "      python\n",
        "      from flask import Flask\n",
        "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///yourdatabase.db'  # or other database URI\n",
        "db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "Define Models:\n",
        "python\n",
        "class User(db.Model):\n",
        "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
        "    name = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)\n",
        "Create the Database   \n",
        "11.  What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
        "     -   The role of Flask-SQLAlchemy is to integrate SQLAlchemy ORM seamlessly with Flask, simplifying database setup and operations. It provides an easy-to-use interface for defining data models, managing database connections, and performing CRUD operations within a Flask application, all while adhering to Flask's conventions.\n",
        " 12.   What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful\n",
        "       -  Flask blueprints are modular components that allow you to organize your Flask application into smaller, reusable parts. They enable you to define routes, error handlers, and static files separately and then register them with the main application. This helps in managing complex applications by promoting better organization, code reuse, and maintainability.\n",
        " 13.  What is the purpose of Flask's request object  \n",
        "       -  The purpose of Flask's request object is to provide access to incoming request data, such as form inputs, URL parameters, headers, cookies, and files. It allows you to retrieve and handle data sent by clients to your Flask application within route functions.\n",
        " 14.  How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask\n",
        "      - To create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask, you typically define a route with appropriate HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and return data in JSON format\n",
        " 15.   What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function\n",
        "       - The purpose of Flask's jsonify() function is to convert Python data structures (like dictionaries and lists) into a JSON-formatted response object. It also sets the correct Content-Type: application/json header, making it suitable for returning JSON data from API endpoints.\n",
        "16.   Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "       - Flask’s url_for() function generates a URL to a specified route endpoint based on the route’s function name and optional parameters. It helps in creating dynamic URLs that adapt to changes in route definitions, ensuring that links within your application remain consistent and maintainable\n",
        "17.   How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
        "      -  Flask handles static files—such as CSS, JavaScript, images—by serving them from a designated folder named static in your project directory. By default, Flask automatically makes files in this folder accessible via URLs like /static/<filename>. You can reference these files in your HTML templates using url_for('static', filename='path/to/file')\n",
        " 18.   What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API\n",
        "       -   An API specification is a detailed, formal document that describes how an API works, including endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, authentication, and error handling. It serves as a blueprint for developers, ensuring clear communication and consistency.\n",
        " 19.   What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API\n",
        "      -  HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by a server to indicate the result of a client's request. They provide vital information about whether the request was successful, resulted in an error, or requires further action.\n",
        "  20.  How do you handle POST requests in Flask\n",
        "       - HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by a server to indicate the result of a client's request. They provide vital information about whether the request was successful, resulted in an error, or requires further action.\n",
        " 21.  How would you secure a Flask API\n",
        "       - Authentication\n",
        " 22.  What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension\n",
        "      -  The Flask-RESTful extension is significant because it simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs with Flask. It provides a set of tools and classes that facilitate creating, organizing, and managing API endpoints more efficiently\n",
        " 23.  What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "      -   The role of Flask’s session object is to store and persist user-specific data across multiple requests. It allows you to keep track of information like user login status, preferences, or other stateful data during a user’s session with your web application.                                               \n",
